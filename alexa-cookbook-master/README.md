### Alexa Skill Building Cookbook
## Ingredients <a id="title"></a>


#### Welcome! <a id="intro"></a>


These folders contain short code samples that show you how to add features to an Alexa skill.
Let's assume we are a chef, with an idea for a fancy new recipe.
The recipe will require one or more ingredients to be combined to create the finished product.
Alexa skills follow the same model. Basic ingredients can be added together to create a robust skill.
This Cookbook is a desk reference for other Alexa skill design materials.
