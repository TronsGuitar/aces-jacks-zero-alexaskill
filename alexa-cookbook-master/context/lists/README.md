## What You Will Learn
*  [AWS Lambda](http://aws.amazon.com/lambda)
*  [Alexa Skills Kit (ASK)](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit)
*  Lists for Alexa Skills

## What You Will Need
*  [Amazon Developer Portal Account](http://developer.amazon.com)
*  [Amazon Web Services Account](http://aws.amazon.com/)
*  The sample code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Alexa/alexa-cookbook/context/lists).

## What Your Skill Will Do
Customers can review and modify their Alexa lists using voice through a device with Alexa or via the Alexa app. For example, a customer can tell Alexa to add items to the Alexa Shopping List at home, and then while at the store, view the items via the Alexa app, and check them off. Third-party developers can make their skills have the ability to read and modify these two Alexa lists. Skills can request permissions to read and write the customer Alexa lists.

When a user enables a skill within the Alexa app, the user will be prompted to provide consent for the read and write permissions. The customer can then ask for the top item on the to-do list or request to delete the top to-do item. It is important to note that when a user enables a skill via voice, the user will not be prompted for this information and the default choice will be "none." In this case, you can use cards to prompt the user to provide consent using the Alexa app.
