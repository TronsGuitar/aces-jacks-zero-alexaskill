Are you looking to create a kids skill? 

Mix Master is a skill that highlights the key design principles for creating skills for kids.

1. Consider the Age Range You Want to Reach
2. Foster Curiosity and Exploration
3. Guide Kids through the Interactions
4. Include Memorable Moments
5. Deliver Fresh Content 
6. Polish Your Skill Name and Description

A child would enter the skill and prompt Alexa to start the game. Mix Master would then respond with two elements, and the user has to guess what the elements combine into.
> Alexa, tell Mix Master to start game.
> 
> Think about what water and dirt could make. <audio plays> What do they make?
> 
> Mud
> 
> Wowza, you got it! Mud was right.
> 

Once the user has specified the correct answer, they can choose to play in this environment. For example, if they affirm want to play with "mud", Alexa would respond:
> Now you are in a stinky smelly swamp! Be careful where you step!

And play corresponding audio.
